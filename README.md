## Hi there 👋
Looks like you managed to find my GitHub profile!👽

## 🌟 About Me

- 💻 **Studies**: I'm currently studying at Hive Helsinki
- 👽 **Currently Learning**: Coding using C and C++
- ✨ **Hobbies/Interests**: Currently trying to finish my movie and book collections!

  I'm an aspiring coder and future/present problem solver! I have a love/hate relationship with debugging since I'm good at it but always when I debug that
  means something is wrong. I'm currently reaching the end of my studies at Hive Helsinki and looking for internships/junior positions. Don't be afraid of reaching
  out to me via linkedin if any questions regarding my projects, work opportunities (nudge nudge) or if you just want to chat. 👩‍🚀

## ✨ Fun Quote (Cause why not?)
- "That which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed."
- - Wonder if anyone can figure out the mystery of where this is from?
