## Hi there 👋
Looks like you managed to find my GitHub profile!👽

## 🌟 About Me

- 💻 **Studies**: I'm currently studying at Hive Helsinki
- 👽 **Currently Learning**: Coding using C and C++
- ✨ **Hobbies/Interests**: Currently trying to finish my movie and book collections!

  I'm an aspiring coder and future/present problem solver! I have a love/hate relationship with debugging since I'm good at it but debugging also means something has gone wrong.
  I'm currently reaching the end of my studies at Hive Helsinki and looking for internships/junior positions. Don't be afraid of reaching
  out to me via linkedin if any questions regarding my projects, work opportunities (nudge nudge) or if you just want to chat. 👩‍🚀

## ✨ Fun Quote (Cause why not?)
- "That which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed."
- - Wonder if anyone can figure out the mystery of where this is from?
