## Hi there 👋
Looks like you managed to find my GitHub profile!👽

## 🌟 About Me

- 💻 **Studies**: In the final stretch of my software engineering studies at Hive Helsinki!
- 👽 **Currently Learning**: Deepening my skills in C and C++ while staying curious and open to new tools and technologies
- ✨ **Hobbies/Interests**: Growing my movie and book collections (always happy to hear recommendations)

  I'm an aspiring developer with a strong interest in solving real-world problems through code. Debugging can test my patience, but it’s also where I learn the most, and I’ve come to embrace it. As I approach the end of my studies at Hive Helsinki, I’m   actively looking for internship or junior developer opportunities where I can continue learning, growing, and making meaningful contributions.

  If you're curious about my projects, have an opportunity to share, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. I'm always open to a good tech chat or a new challenge 👩‍🚀
